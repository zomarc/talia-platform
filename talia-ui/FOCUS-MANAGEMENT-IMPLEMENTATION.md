- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient focus management

## üöÄ **Integration Points**

### **Current Integration**
- **InstantDB**: Full database integration
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control
- **React Context**: User state management
- **Component System**: Modular architecture

### **Future Integration**
- **Main Dashboard**: Replace current layout system
- **Dockview**: Enhanced layout management
- **Component Library**: Expand available components
- **Real-time Data**: Live data updates

## üìã **Usage Examples**

### **Admin Usage**
```javascript
// Initialize standard focuses
await focusService.initializeStandardFocuses(adminUserId);

// Create new standard focus
await focusService.createFocus({
  name: 'Custom Analytics',
  description: 'Advanced analytics dashboard',
  type: 'standard',
  role: 'manager',
  components: [...]
}, adminUserId);
```

### **User Usage**
```javascript
// Load available focuses
const focuses = await focusService.getAvailableFocuses(userId, userRole);

// Switch focus
await focusService.loadFocus(focusId);

// Mark favorite
await focusService.toggleFavorite(focusId);
```

### **Component Usage**
```jsx
// In React component
const { focuses, currentFocus, loadFocus } = useFocusManagement();

// Switch to different focus
const handleFocusChange = (focusId) => {
  loadFocus(focusId);
};
```

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **Integration Tasks**
1. **Dashboard Integration**: Replace current layout system with focus management
2. **Component Library**: Expand available component types
