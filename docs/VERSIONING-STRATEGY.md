# Talia Versioning Strategy
## Stability-Driven Development Versioning

**Official Strategy Document**  
**Effective Date**: January 2, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.0  

---

## 🎯 **Strategy Overview**

Talia uses a **stability-driven versioning strategy** designed for development-stage projects that require stable, demonstrable artifacts while allowing for experimental feature development.

### **Core Principle**
*"Every major version (x.0.0) represents a stable, confirmed, deployable baseline that can be demonstrated to stakeholders with confidence."*

---

## 📋 **Version Format: x.y.z**

### **x (Major - Stability Level)**
Defines the **stability and maturity level** of the system:

| Version | Stability Level | Description | Demonstration Status |
|---------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **1.x.x** | Experimental | Development/Proof-of-Concept | Internal only |
| **2.x.x** | Stable/Demonstrable | Working baseline, feature complete | Stakeholder ready |
| **3.x.x** | Production Ready | Deployed, monitored, supported | Customer ready |
| **4.x.x** | Enterprise/Advanced | Advanced features, scalability | Enterprise ready |

### **y (Minor - Feature/Release)**
Represents **feature branches and major additions** to the current stability level:

- **x.0.x** = Baseline for stability level
- **x.1.x** = First major feature set
- **x.2.x** = Second major feature set
- **x.3.x** = Third major feature set
- etc.

### **z (Patch - Iterations)**
Handles **minor enhancements and bug fixes** to the main development path:

- **x.y.0** = Initial feature implementation
- **x.y.1** = Bug fixes and refinements
- **x.y.2** = Minor enhancements
- **x.y.3** = Additional refinements
- etc.

## 🔧 **Development Workflow**

### **Stable Baseline Development (v2.0.x)**
```bash
# Work on stable baseline improvements
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Make bug fixes and minor enhancements
git commit -m "fix: resolve GraphQL query issue"
git tag v2.0.1
```

### **Feature Branch Development (v2.1.x)**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/focus-management
# Develop new features
git commit -m "feat: implement focus management UI"
# Test and refine
git commit -m "fix: resolve focus persistence issue"
git tag v2.1.0
# Merge to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge feature/focus-management
```

### **Major Version Promotion (v2.x.x → v3.0.0)**
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v3.0.0
# Complete production readiness tasks
git commit -m "feat: production deployment configuration"
git tag v3.0.0
